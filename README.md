## Summary

<This repository includes the code, datasets (raw and processed), and output used for the project focused on interconnected environmental challenges: CO₂ emissions, renewable energy, and air pollution in the context of UN Sustainability Goals. 

This project explored the correlation between CO₂ emissions and renewable energy use, PM2.5 exposure, and clean cooking access in two developed (USA, Germany) and two developing (China, Colombia) countries from 2010 to 2020. Comparative analysis, correlation analysis, and time-series analysis were leveraged to complete the project. 

We chose this topic because these indicators reflect critical goals under the UN Sustainable Development Agenda—SDG 7 (Clean Energy), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 3 (Health). Understanding these links helps support more effective, equitable policy solutions.>

## Keywords

<Sustainable Development; CO₂ Emissions; Renewable Energy; Air Pollution; UN SDGs>

## Database Information

<The dataset was collected from the World Bank Databank, specifically the World Development Indicators. This is a comprehensive and reliable database compiled from officially recognized international sources. The date of access is #####.>


## Folder structure, file formats, and naming conventions 

<This repository contains four folders for raw data, processed data, code, and output respectively. Raw and processed data folders contain Excel data files for data wrangling and storage, while the code and output folders include R scripts.

Files are named according to the following naming convention: 

`Country_Datadescription_Stage.format`, where: 

**Country** refers to the country where the data originated

**Datadescription** is a description of data 

**stage**refers to the stage in data management pipelines (e.g., raw, cleaned, or processed)

**format** is a non-proprietary file format (e.g., .csv, .txt)>


## Metadata

<For each data file in the repository, describe the data contained in each column. Include the column name, a description of the information, the class of data, and any units associated with the data. Create a list or table for each data file.> 

## Scripts and code

<R scripts are leveraged in the repository for data wrangling, data exploration, data visualization, and data analysis.>
